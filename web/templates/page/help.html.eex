<p>Emotext is a chat app that uses commands for textual representation of feelings or emotions.  It is build on a high performance erlang/elixir/phoenix/postgres stack.</p>


<h3><a name="commands">Commands</a></h3>

<p>Commands can be entered using a slash character (<b>/</b>).  So to enter a smile command, you would type <b>/smile</b>.  For a full list of commands you would type <b>/?</b>.</p>

<p>Commands can be used against other people in the app.  For example if you want to smile at a user named 'Fred' you would type <b>/smile fred</b>.</p>

<p>Assuming your username is 'Bob', the result would be: <br/>
	<ul>
		<li>you would see <b>You smile happily at Fred.</b></li>
		<li>Fred would see <b>Bob smiles happily at you.</b></li>
		<li>anyone else in the app would see <b>Bob smiles happily at Fred.</b></li>
	</ul>
